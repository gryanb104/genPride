# genPride

genPride is a snakemake-based workflow for analysis of metagenomic sequence read data. It can be used for any of these purposes:

  1.) Determining the taxonomic makeup of a community represented by a metagenomic fasta/fastq file
  2.) Comparing and contrasting the taxonomic makeup of two communities
  3.) Reporting quality scores and time requirements of each analysis step (assembly of short reads, protein-coding prediction, and cluis and taxonomic classification of nucleotide or protein sequences)
