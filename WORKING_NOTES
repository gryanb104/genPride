*Started taking working notes
*Did an sbatch run
	-Failed after about 2.5 hours
	-Error code indicates that the reads are not the same 
	 length
*Did another sbatch run
	-This time with the files that had not been cut down to 
	 one million lines
	-Also failed, still not the same number of reads
	-Dr. Biller suggested using seqtk or seqkit packages 
	 (both installed in subdirectories under /nobackup1/
	 chisholmlab/software)
*There was a github issue
	-Struggled for a long time
	-Finally overwrote the origin (github) branch with the
	 main (local) branch
*Copied gray directory into nobackup1

*STILL NEED TO DO:
	-Make the fastq files have the same number of reads
	-Do this as another snakemake rule?
	-clone genPride git repo into nobackup1

*Get fastq subsamples with equal numbers of reads
	-Reading up on seqtk
	-Can't figure out how to use it from the chisholm direct-
		ory
	-Installing seqtk into nobackup1/billerlab
	-Run seqtk sample -s100 test_fwd_tmp.fastq.gz 1000000 >
		subset_fwd.fastq.gz and same for bwd
*Got github pushing and pulling working from nobackup1
	-Simultaneously lost the ability to do so from the home
		directory (cying emoji)
*Attempt to run genPride snakemake using these new subset files
	-Done so by running bash test_script.sh
	-Error: not a gzipped file?
*I'm going home early fuck this

*Run test script (as of now, made to set up some parameters and
	run assemble_meat.sh)
	-Error: not gzip files
	-Correct by zipping files using gzip -f
*Run test script again
	-Runs, but on root node
	-Copy and paste sbatch stuff from GP_RUN
	-That ran it on the head node again
*Run again, this time using sbatch instead of bash
	-Submitted job!Did not take very long Looks like it wo-
		rked!!!
	-Deleted results files and pushed
*Try running GP_RUN 
	-Have to do so after activating the snakemake environm-
		ent
	-Have to do sbatch instead of bash also
	-Not working
	-I don't know what I did, but it is maybe working now?
		#I think I had to simplify the run script to o-
			nly snakemake --cores 1, get rid of all
			the other stuff
	-Seems to have worked!	
*While that is running, fix github connection from home direct-
	ory
	-Delete home repo and clone back again
	-Presumed successful
