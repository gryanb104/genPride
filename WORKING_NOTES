*Started taking working notes
*Did an sbatch run
	-Failed after about 2.5 hours
	-Error code indicates that the reads are not the same 
	 length
*Did another sbatch run
	-This time with the files that had not been cut down to 
	 one million lines
	-Also failed, still not the same number of reads
	-Dr. Biller suggested using seqtk or seqkit packages 
	 (both installed in subdirectories under /nobackup1/
	 chisholmlab/software)
*There was a github issue
	-Struggled for a long time
	-Finally overwrote the origin (github) branch with the
	 main (local) branch
*Copied gray directory into nobackup1

*STILL NEED TO DO:
	-Make the fastq files have the same number of reads
	-Do this as another snakemake rule?
	-clone genPride git repo into nobackup1
