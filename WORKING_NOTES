3/7/2023
	*Give the full workflow a shot! Let's see how it runs
		-Didn't work, there was a syntax error in Snak-
			efile... fixed
		-gorg-classifier bash script not found
		-Okay, issue is a typo lol
			#jk it's actually not
			#added html to txt process in the scri-
				pt so I can easily view logs
		-Some issue with exiting with an error code: c-
			ombatting by installing docker via con-
			da
			#still didn't work
		-Removed profile option: now it says that kaiju
			command cannot run
			#fixed
	*Add status report into GORG script: working
	*Run with the whole dataset (cellular)

3/8/2023
	*Check on the run: still going (it's at 16:24:13)

		-On its own: DONE!
		-Into snakemake workflow: working on it now
		-After much difficulty... DONE

3/9/2023
	*adding gorg classification information to the final r-
		eport
		-Left off struggling with the GORG report part

3/10/2023
	*return to adding gorg classification to final report
		-seems to be working!!!
	*getting the krona step into the final report: DONE
	*next: comparison thing... still figuring out how to a-
		pproach this
	*set up megahit assignment for Anika

3/15/2023
	*get cellular runn going through krona rule
	*test run of the tourmaline snakemake workflow for cor-
		al data
	*get kofamscan kegg counts rule into snakemake

3/16/2023
	*cellular krona: final report assembly didn't work, th-
		ere was no quast report
		-deleted slurm_quast.out and rerun
		-the krona was accessible though, sent to Dr B-
			iller
	*started a cellular run to try to fix the issue with t-
		he inability to assemble the final report
			#WORKED!
	*get the vessicle and viral runs started as well
		-vessicle is running, waiting on viral run bec-
			ause disk quota exceeded in cache/snak-
			emake
	*test run of tourmaline from yesterday: FAILED (I guess
		I was not in the snakemake environment)
		-Trying again correctly

3/17/2023
	*check vessicle run: still going
	*check tourmaline workflow run: there were errors
		-added a conda init bash line to fix one of the

		-the manifest_pe data file is empty, so I fixed
			that as well
		-started a new run
		-worked! waiting on formatted files before run-

	*check vesicle run (through gorg, through krona) - res-
		tarted with all cores and longer time limit

3/29/2023
	*check vessicle run: it's done, take a look at it
		-seems to have run correctly, krona sent to Dr.
		Biller
