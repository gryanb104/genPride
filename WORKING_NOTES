			#moving everything out
			#plots made and sent to Dr. Biller
			#NEXT STEPS: 
				*use cluster ID for the gene c-
					olor fill
				*reorder, by sequence identity?
				*look at the distribution of r-
					eads from different ta-
					xonomic groupings in e-
					ach cluster 
				*put together a list of what M-
					GE genes are found wit-
					hin each cluster and t-

		-clustering mge: issue with yellow showing up

		-clustering mge
			#added col=V(sub_mge_graph_1)$color and

		-clustering mge:
			#fixed the yellow issue, made the poin-

	*next steps:
		-clustering mge:
			#manual pull out of aux clusters
			#move legend, make larger
			#kk layout
			#shrink figure of aux clusters? try ot-
		
				her seeds?
		-loci v loci:
			#use cluster ID for the gene color fill
                        #reorder, by sequence identity?
			#look at the distribution of reads from
				different tax groupings in each
