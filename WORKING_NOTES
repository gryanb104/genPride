		-Get Mary's assignment set up
			#kofamscan for kegg counts
		-Consolidate some things into functions in mod-
			ules
		-Get going on the GORG classifier step
		-Interpret rgm model results
	*Done
		-Mary's kofamscan assignment is set up
			#at next week's meeting I will give her
				the rundown
		
3/1/2023
	*Met with Anika to fix some issues with the trimming s-
		cript
		-Now she is working on the report part of it
	*Looked at rgm model stuff, sent results to Dr. Biller

3/2/2023
	*Today: let's try to get the conda environment updated
	*GP running: everything is fine, we good
	*Next, simplifying some things into functions
		-Still working on this

		ctions in a report module
	*moving away from that and working on GORG classifier
	*have to install nextflow
		-Done
	*GORG step might be working now, tbd. Try running work-

3/7/2023
	*Give the full workflow a shot! Let's see how it runs
		-Didn't work, there was a syntax error in Snak-

		-gorg-classifier bash script not found
		-Okay, issue is a typo lol
			#jk it's actually not
			#added html to txt process in the scri-
				pt so I can easily view logs
		-Some issue with exiting with an error code: c-
			ombatting by installing docker via con-

	*Add status report into GORG script: working
	*Run with the whole dataset (cellular)

3/8/2023
	*Check on the run: still going (it's at 16:24:13)
	*Let's see about putting a kaiju to krona step in there
		-On its own: DONE!
		-Into snakemake workflow: working on it now
		-After much difficulty... DONE

3/9/2023
	*adding gorg classification information to the final r-
		eport
		-Left off struggling with the GORG report part

3/10/2023
	*return to adding gorg classification to final report
		-seems to be working!!!
	*getting the krona step into the final report: DONE
	*next: comparison thing... still figuring out how to a-
		pproach this
	*Set up megahit assignment for Anika
